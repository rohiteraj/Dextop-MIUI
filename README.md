Dextop is an open-source Android app that creates a virtual display and provides a desktop-like workspace using only a smartphone. Dextop 1.5.0 and later include a built-in privileged access runtime, which works with Android system services to control app launching, window placement, touch input, orientation, and related desktop behavior.

## Compatibility

| Environment | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Samsung DeX (One UI 8 or later) | Fully supported | Currently the most complete environment. Features managed by DeX use Samsung's platform implementation. |
| Samsung DeX (earlier than One UI 8) | Limited and likely incompatible | Older DeX implementations may not provide the display and window-management behavior required by Dextop. |
| Google Pixel | Limited and incomplete | Depends on Android's freeform/desktop implementation and hidden API availability. Some features may not work. |
| OPPO ColorOS desktop | Limited and incomplete | The desktop can be displayed, but platform components such as the taskbar may not appear. |
| Xiaomi devices running HyperOS or later | Disabled | MIUI and HyperOS are not supported. |
| Other Android devices | Experimental | Virtual-display, mirroring, and freeform support varies by manufacturer, model, and OS update. |

The Android Auto entry is exposed through the parked-app `CAR_LAUNCHER` activity on Android 15 and later. Android Auto's host still decides whether a sideloaded app is shown; its current public parked-app support is limited to approved categories.

Dextop probes device capabilities at runtime and tries compatible backends in order. It still depends on Android hidden APIs and OEM behavior, so results can differ between models and OS versions from the same manufacturer.

## System requirements

- Android 10 or later. Most devices require Android 14 or later for a usable desktop environment.
- Dextop 1.5.0 or later, including the latest release

Dextop 1.5.0 and later include the access service needed for normal operation, so no external app or separate privileged service is required. Setup and first use can be completed with Dextop alone; Android may still show system permission or wireless-debugging pairing screens when required by the device.

Root, Stellar, Shizuku, and other compatible privileged services remain supported. If one is already available, Dextop detects the environment and automatically adapts to and uses it, so an existing setup does not need to be migrated or replaced.

## Installation

The Google Play release is currently under review.

Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/releases/latest) and install it.

### Nightly builds

The latest development build is available from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/actions). Open the newest successful **Debug APK** workflow run and download its Nightly artifact to try changes that have not reached a stable release yet. The artifact contains matching Dextop and Dextop Car Companion debug APKs. Nightly builds are beta builds generated from the latest source and may contain unfinished features or regressions.

Stable GitHub Releases include both the Dextop APK and the matching **Dextop Car Companion** APK when Android Auto support is included. Install both APKs from the same release so their signatures and relay protocol match.

## Android Auto quick start

Dextop supports a dedicated desktop on supported parked Android Auto displays through **Dextop Car Companion** on Android 15 or later.

1. Install Dextop and the matching **Dextop Car Companion** APK from the same release.
2. Complete Dextop's phone setup. On version 1.5.0 and later, Dextop configures its built-in access automatically; if root or a compatible privileged service such as Stellar or Shizuku is already available, Dextop detects and uses it automatically.
3. Connect Android Auto while parked and open **Dextop Car Companion** from the car launcher.
4. Select **Start**. Touch input is sent directly from the head unit to the Auto-owned Dextop display.
5. Swipe right from the left edge of the car display to open the Auto controls for workspaces, video reconnection, and stopping the session.

Android Auto controls whether a sideloaded parked app appears on a particular head unit. The default compatibility mode may show the Auto virtual-display overlay on the phone; an experimental hidden-display mode is available under **Dextop → Settings → Auto**. See the [Android Auto wiki](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/wiki/Android-Auto) for installation details, display modes, gestures, controls, limitations, DHU testing, and troubleshooting.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop.git
cd Dextop
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
```

## Diagnostics

Open **Settings → App information → Operation log and device diagnostics** to view, copy, or share device specifications, capability probes, fallback results, and Dextop operation logs. Remove any personal information you do not want to publish before attaching a report to an issue.

## Device reports

Open **Settings → Device report** to report how Dextop works on a specific device and firmware. Choose **Working**, **Not working**, or **Not tested** for the overall result and every listed feature, add optional notes, then tap **Send report by email**. Dextop prepares a structured Markdown report and opens your email app with `dextop-device@n4t.su` as the recipient.

The report includes the device model, codename, Android/API version, firmware identifiers, security patch, Dextop version, detected capabilities, and the results you selected. Review the generated email before sending it. See [Device reports](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/wiki/Device-Reports) for the complete field list and procedure.
